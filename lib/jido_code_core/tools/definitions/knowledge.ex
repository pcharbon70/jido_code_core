defmodule JidoCodeCore.Tools.Definitions.Knowledge do
  @moduledoc """
  Tool definitions for knowledge graph operations.

  This module defines tools for storing and querying knowledge in the
  long-term memory system using the Jido ontology.

  ## Available Tools

  - `knowledge_remember` - Store new knowledge with ontology typing
  - `knowledge_recall` - Query knowledge with semantic filters
  - `knowledge_supersede` - Mark knowledge as outdated and optionally replace
  - `knowledge_update` - Update confidence or add evidence to existing knowledge
  - `project_conventions` - Retrieve project conventions and coding standards
  - `project_decisions` - Retrieve architectural and implementation decisions
  - `project_risks` - Retrieve known risks and potential issues

  ## Memory Types

  The following memory types are supported (from the Jido ontology):

  **Knowledge Types:**
  - `:fact` - Verified or strongly established knowledge
  - `:assumption` - Unverified belief held for working purposes
  - `:hypothesis` - Testable theory or explanation
  - `:discovery` - Newly uncovered important information
  - `:risk` - Potential future negative outcome
  - `:unknown` - Known unknown; explicitly acknowledged knowledge gap

  **Convention Types:**
  - `:convention` - General project-wide or system-wide standard
  - `:coding_standard` - Convention related to coding style or structure

  **Decision Types:**
  - `:decision` - General committed choice impacting the project
  - `:architectural_decision` - High-impact structural or architectural choice
  - `:implementation_decision` - Lower-level implementation choice with rationale
  - `:alternative` - Considered option that was not selected
  - `:lesson_learned` - Insights gained from past experiences

  ## Usage

      # Register all knowledge tools
      for tool <- Knowledge.all() do
        :ok = Registry.register(tool)
      end

      # Or get a specific tool
      remember_tool = Knowledge.knowledge_remember()
      :ok = Registry.register(remember_tool)

  Returns the knowledge_context tool definition.

  Automatically retrieves the most relevant memories based on a context hint.
  Unlike knowledge_recall which requires explicit queries, knowledge_context
  uses relevance scoring to find memories that are contextually appropriate.

  ## Parameters

  - `context_hint` (required, string) - Description of the current task or question
  - `include_types` (optional, array) - Filter to specific memory types
  - `min_confidence` (optional, number) - Minimum confidence threshold (default: 0.5)
  - `limit` (optional, integer) - Maximum results (default: 5)
  - `recency_weight` (optional, number) - Weight for recency in scoring (default: 0.3)
  - `include_superseded` (optional, boolean) - Include superseded memories (default: false)

  ## Relevance Scoring

  Each memory is scored based on:
  - **Text similarity (40%)** - How well the context hint matches memory content
  - **Recency (30%)** - How recently the memory was accessed or created
  - **Confidence (20%)** - The memory's confidence level
  - **Access frequency (10%)** - How often the memory has been accessed

  Returns JSON with context_hint, count, and scored memories array.
